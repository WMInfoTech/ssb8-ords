Self-Service Banner 8
=====================

An image to run SSB8 using
[ORDS](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/rest.html).

Before building, be sure you mirror ORDS locally and provide it as a build
argument named ORDS_URL. The URL can also be a relative file path below your
working directory - it's just fed to the `ADD` keyworkd in a Dockerfile.
